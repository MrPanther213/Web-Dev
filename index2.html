 <p><strong>Dodges</strong> are a common thing to use in competition to dodge opponents attacks. use them wisely and strategically because if use wrong. It could cost the game. </p>
<p> <strong>Smash Attacks</strong> are charged attacks. some characters Smash attacks hit farther then their normal attacks</p>
<p> <strong>Fighting Tips////////////////////////////////</strong>
    Some Fighters can move while crouched - and can duck under certain attacks and projectiles.
    Some Fighters can wall jump when touching a wall by Tilting L-Stick in the opposite direction of the wall.
    A few Fighters that wall jump can actually remain stuck to a wall a brief time: (Sheik, Squirtle, Diddy Kong, Lucario, Greninja, Bayonetta)
    Using the same attack constantly will decrease its power. This is called stale moves. Use variety!
    Dodging too many times in a row makes each dodge less effective.
    You can grab an item in midair by dodging or attacking at the right moment.
    You can jump on an opponents head to use a springboard. If they are airborne they will fall down and hit the ground.
    You can break your fall when hitting the wall, floor, ceiling after being launched by hitting the shield button. Tapping the shield button will spring your character upright, while tapping shield + a direction will initiate a dodge-roll.
    Tapping the Jump + Attack button will initiate an automatic "Shorthop" attack, letting you perform aerial attacks low to the ground.
    If you are behind in the match, you can sometimes spawn with a Final Smash ready to use.
    If you turn around while running and grab, your grab range will be longer.
    Fighters like Samus and the Belmonts can use their grab to grapple onto the edge of a level.
    Timed Battles don't rely on the last Fighter standing. Your score is determined by the amount of KOs you've dealt, minus the amount of times you've been KO'd or fallen.
    Different stages call for different tactics, but they all revolve around racking up damage and getting knocked away. If you are knocked away, you have a double jump and something called a Recovery move, a special move that gives you one last chance at getting back onto the stage.
    You can have more items appear if you also enable Containers in the item settings.
    You cannot use the Fairy Bottle unless you have over 100% damage. You can toss it to another fighter with that much damage and it'll heal them on impact.</p>
